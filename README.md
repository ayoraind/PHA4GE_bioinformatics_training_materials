# Training materials for PHA4GE bioinformatics workshop 2021
The Nigeria node of the Global Health Research Unit for the Genomic Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance [GHRU-GSA](https://ghru.pathogensurveillance.net/) organized this workshop to provide an entry-point for hospital laboratory staff and field epidemiologists to take the first steps in analyzing and interpreting sequence data in order to provide biologically relevant information that will guide infection prevention and control practices within their local hospital, and by extension, the country. 

GHRU Nigeria  - led by [Iruka N. Okeke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iruka_Okeke) - is responsible for the genomic surveillance of multidrug-resistant and globally-recognized high priority pathogens as well as endemic pathogens in Nigeria. GHRU Nigeria is hosted at the [University of Ibadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ibadan), a research hub of excellence that is internationally distinguished for its exceptional research activities and academic standards.
